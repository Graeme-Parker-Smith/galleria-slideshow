          Although The Starry Night was painted during the day in Van Gogh's
          ground-floor studio, it would be inaccurate to state that the picture
          was painted from memory. The view has been identified as the one from
          his bedroom window, facing east, a view which Van Gogh painted
          variations of no fewer than twenty-one times, including The Starry
          Night. "Through the iron-barred window," he wrote to his brother,
          Theo, around 23 May 1889, "I can see an enclosed square of wheat ...
          above which, in the morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory."
